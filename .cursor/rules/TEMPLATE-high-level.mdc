Here is documentation that outlines the breadcrumbs implementation:
<documentation>
`documents/guides/_breadcrumb_navigtion_system.md`
[_breadcrumb_navigation_system.md](mdc:documents/guides/_breadcrumb_navigation_system.md)
</documentation>

Here are the steps you MUST follow after making any changes to any files mentioned in this documentation:
<post_edit_code_changes>
1. After making updates to the code, you MUST ensure that the documentation reflects the most up to date state of the code.
2. Find and read the documentation using `file_search` and `read_file`.
3. Compare the guide against the updated implementation.
4. If discrepancies exist, update documentation using `edit_file`.

Remember: the documentation must be comprehensive and information-dense. Focus on technical functionality and observed behavior, not presentation or aesthetics. You don't always need to update the docs, but you always need to check whether you need to.
</post_edit_code_changes>

<pre_cognition>
- Before making or proposing any changes to files mentioned in the documentation, first assess whether the changes will impact other parts of the implementation.
- If yes, you MUST first use `file_search`/`grep_search` and `read_file` tools to find the relevant files/code and understand their functionality.
- Only then proceed to answer the user's question or make code changes.
